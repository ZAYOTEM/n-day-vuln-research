Tested on : Windows 10

Description : Frhed.exe application has a buffer owerflow vulnerability in its command line argument. 

The Exploit Code bypasses SafeSEH protection by jumping to an address outside the address range of the installed modules and then jumping back to the shellcode in memory. 

To bypass SafeSEH protection, a byte in the opcode, which is used to jump back to the shellcode in memory, changes every time the program is restarted. Therefore, when that one byte is matched, the exploit code works successfully

*shellcode :* 

```
msfvenom -p windows/exec cmd=notepad.exe -f c -e x86/alpha_mixed
```
